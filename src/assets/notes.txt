     based on the path you are going to display the page.
	 
	 
  
  
  html code
  <a href="page1.html"> page1 </a>   ---> you will be land into the page1
  
  
   localhost:4200/page1
   (page1 output)

https://localhost:4200   

https://localhost:4200/main           -->  path : https://localhost:4200/main ,     component  : Maincomponent
https://localhost:4200/Employee       -->  path : https://localhost:4200/employee , component : Employee comp
https://localhost:4200/EmployeeDetails --> path : https://localhost:4200/employeedetails , component : empdetailsccomp

  






1. i need to prepare the outlet to capture the main component
  
  
  
  
  1.   I AM SENDING THE PARAMeter from employee page to employeedetails


  2. when you are landed into employeedetails
       we have to take the value from the url


  A :  you have to take the activate router and subscribe the  params of that activate route then you will receive the parametes from list
      you will recevie the what are the parameters from the url
  


  // https://localhost:4200/EmployeeDetails --> path : https://localhost:4200/employeedetails , component : empdetailsccomp
  


  https://github.com/madanpatakota?tab=repositories    - querystring
  https://github.com/madanpatakota#repositories        - fragment


  Ways of wringing the code 
  1. Params           -- completed
       .html
       .ts

  2. querystring      -- completed
       .html          -- done
       .ts            --

  3. fragment         -- todo
       .html
       .ts



  http://localhost:4200/employeedetails/1              - params
  http://localhost:4200/employeedetails?ID = 1         - querystring
  http://localhost:4200/employeedetails#1             - fragment
  




  How you are going to provide the guards to the route?

  whenever you are entering in anycompany the way how you are going to show your id then office guard will allow to you.


  so whenever you are going to give the login crediantials and login ---> you are going to navigathe the next screen


  login screen -- for gives your idenity
